### Projects 

### Exploratory Data Analysis : 
          Banking data set with information of customers on demographic details, previous loans, credit scores, repayment details, purpose of loan, defaults etc. analyzed with various python libraries with key finds as mentioned below. 
          
      ### Conclusions
              1. Education type , Occupation type, EXT source, dependents, yield group and Annuity of the goods category are the major driving parameters.
              2. Major defaults are consumer loans with small Annuity from new or repeaters from % as well as counts point of view
                 People having academic degree are less likely to be a defaulter
              3. People with secondary education, higher secondary are more like to be defulters
              4. Mobiles, computers, consumer electronics and audio/video equipment encounter huge no. of defaults from people with high income specifically young.
              5. Youngsters or newly employed people tend to default more as compared to mid or old age people who are quite experienced in their profession
                 Bank should focus more on refreshed applications
              6. Target crowd for bank can be goods education, previous loans repayed, mid range income and good ext score

### Linear Regression Model (Bike Sharing case study): 
    Involves data cleaning, data visualizations, feature engineering and multiple linear regression model building using forward approach, automated approach namely 
    Recursive feature elimination method (RFE). 
    Also, the model is built using Sklearn and statistical models to have the sense of statistics behind adding or dropping features. Detailed verification of all the assumptions of linear regression like Linearity of residuals, Independence of residuals, Normal distribution of residuals, Homoscedasticity, Multicollinearity  is done.

### Logistic Regression Model (Telecom Churn data set):
    Binary Logistic Regression model is built after cleaning of data, visualizations and preprocessing to identify the features indicating whether a customer will churn or not. Metrics like confusion matrix, ROC curve, Gini coefficient are used with reference to the metrics like sensitivity, specificity, precision, recall etc. 
    GridSearch is used to find the optimal cutoff to define the success or failure.

### Logistic Regression Model (Edtech Industry Data set): 
  The company markets its courses on several websites and search engines like Google. Once these people land on the website, they might browse the courses or fill up a form for the course or watch some videos. When these people fill up a form providing their email address or phone number, they are classified to be a lead. Moreover, the company also gets leads through past referrals. Once these leads are acquired, employees from the sales team start making calls, writing emails, etc. Through this process, some of the leads get converted while most do not. The typical lead conversion rate at X education is around 30%.
  Logistics Regression model built with around 90% accuracy, precision and recall on training as well as test data set.

### Decision Tree (Diabetes prediction):  
  A machine learning model for the diabetes dataset, algorithm that uses decision tree to analyze medical data and predict the onset or progression of diabetes in patients. The model is trained on a dataset of past patient records, where the presence or absence of diabetes is known, to learn how to make predictions on new patients. Model can accurately identify patients at risk for developing diabetes or monitor the progression of the disease.

The output of the model can provide clinicians with actionable insights into patient health and help inform treatment decisions. By leveraging the power of machine learning, this type of model can improve the accuracy of diabetes diagnosis and management, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes.

Later, RandomForestClassifier is used to demonstrate how well the random forest exploit the power of decision trees.
